There are also instructions for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/pgvector/setup-pgvector).\n\n### Windows\n\nEnsure [C++ support in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#download-and-install-the-tools) is installed and run `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS [version]` as administrator. Then use `nmake` to build:\n\n```cmd\nset \"PGROOT=C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\18\"\ncd %TEMP%\ngit clone --branch v0.8.1 https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git\ncd pgvector\nnmake /F Makefile.win\nnmake /F Makefile.win install\n```\n\nSee the [installation notes](#installation-notes---windows) if you run into issues\n\nYou can also install it with [Docker](#docker) or [conda-forge](#conda-forge).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nEnable the extension (do this once in each database where you want to use it)\n\n```tsql\nCREATE EXTENSION vector;\n```\n\nCreate a vector column with 3 dimensions\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));\n```\n\nInsert vectors\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');\n```\n\nGet the nearest neighbors by L2 distance\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nAlso supports inner product (`<#>`), cosine distance (`<=>`), and L1 distance (`<+>`)\n\nNote: `<#>` returns the negative inner product since Postgres only supports `ASC` order index scans on operators\n\n## Storing\n\nCreate a new table with a vector column\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3));\n```\n\nOr add a vector column to an existing table\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE items ADD COLUMN embedding vector(3);\n```\n\nAlso supports [half-precision](#half-precision-vectors), [binary](#binary-vectors), and [sparse](#sparse-vectors) vectors\n\nInsert vectors\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]');\n```\n\nOr load vectors in bulk using `COPY` ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/loading/example.py))\n\n```sql\nCOPY items (embedding) FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY);\n```\n\nUpsert vectors\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO items (id, embedding) VALUES (1, '[1,2,3]'), (2, '[4,5,6]')\n    ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET embedding = EXCLUDED.embedding;\n```\n\nUpdate vectors\n\n```sql\nUPDATE items SET embedding = '[1,2,3]' WHERE id = 1;\n```\n\nDelete vectors\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM items WHERE id = 1;\n```\n\n## Querying\n\nGet the nearest neighbors to a vector\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nSupported distance functions are:\n\n- `<->` - L2 distance\n- `<#>` - (negative) inner product\n- `<=>` - cosine distance\n- `<+>` - L1 distance\n- `<~>` - Hamming distance (binary vectors)\n- `<%>` - Jaccard distance (binary vectors)\n\nGet the nearest neighbors to a row\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items WHERE id != 1 ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM items WHERE id = 1) LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nGet rows within a certain distance\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items WHERE embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' < 5;\n```\n\nNote: Combine with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to use an index\n\n#### Distances\n\nGet the distance\n\n```sql\nSELECT embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' AS distance FROM items;\n```\n\nFor inner product, multiply by -1 (since `<#>` returns the negative inner product)\n\n```tsql\nSELECT (embedding <#> '[3,1,2]') * -1 AS inner_product FROM items;\n```\n\nFor cosine similarity, use 1 - cosine distance\n\n```sql\nSELECT 1 - (embedding <=> '[3,1,2]') AS cosine_similarity FROM items;\n```\n\n#### Aggregates\n\nAverage vectors\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(embedding) FROM items;\n```\n\nAverage groups of vectors\n\n```sql\nSELECT category_id, AVG(embedding) FROM items GROUP BY category_id;\n```\n\n## Indexing\n\nBy default, pgvector performs exact nearest neighbor search, which provides perfect recall.\n\nYou can add an index to use approximate nearest neighbor search, which trades some recall for speed. Unlike typical indexes, you will see different results for queries after adding an approximate index.\n\nSupported index types are:\n\n- [HNSW](#hnsw)\n- [IVFFlat](#ivfflat)\n\n## HNSW\n\nAn HNSW index creates a multilayer graph. It has better query performance than IVFFlat (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff), but has slower build times and uses more memory. Also, an index can be created without any data in the table since there isn\u2019t a training step like IVFFlat.\n\nAdd an index for each distance function you want to use.\n\nL2 distance\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);\n```\n\nNote: Use `halfvec_l2_ops` for `halfvec` and `sparsevec_l2_ops` for `sparsevec` (and similar with the other distance functions)\n\nInner product\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);\n```\n\nCosine distance\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);\n```\n\nL1 distance\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l1_ops);\n```\n\nHamming distance\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding bit_hamming_ops);\n```\n\nJaccard distance\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding bit_jaccard_ops);\n```\n\nSupported types are:\n\n- `vector` - up to 2,000 dimensions\n- `halfvec` - up to 4,000 dimensions\n- `bit` - up to 64,000 dimensions\n- `sparsevec` - up to 1,000 non-zero elements\n\n### Index Options\n\nSpecify HNSW parameters\n\n- `m` - the max number of connections per layer (16 by default)\n- `ef_construction` - the size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (64 by default)\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);\n```\n\nA higher value of `ef_construction` provides better recall at the cost of index build time / insert speed.\n\n### Query Options\n\nSpecify the size of the dynamic candidate list for search (40 by default)\n\n```sql\nSET hnsw.ef_search = 100;\n```\n\nA higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed.\n\nUse `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set it for a single query\n\n```sql\nBEGIN;\nSET LOCAL hnsw.ef_search = 100;\nSELECT ...\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n### Index Build Time\n\nIndexes build significantly faster when the graph fits into `maintenance_work_mem`\n\n```sql\nSET maintenance_work_mem = '8GB';\n```\n\nA notice is shown when the graph no longer fits\n\n```text\nNOTICE:  hnsw graph no longer fits into maintenance_work_mem after 100000 tuples\nDETAIL:  Building will take significantly more time.\nHINT:  Increase maintenance_work_mem to speed up builds.\n```\n\nNote: Do not set `maintenance_work_mem` so high that it exhausts the memory on the server\n\nLike other index types, it\u2019s faster to create an index after loading your initial data\n\nYou can also speed up index creation by increasing the number of parallel workers (2 by default)\n\n```sql\nSET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7; -- plus leader\n```\n\nFor a large number of workers, you may need to increase `max_parallel_workers` (8 by default)\n\nThe [index options](#index-options) also have a significant impact on build time (use the defaults unless seeing low recall)\n\n### Indexing Progress\n\nCheck [indexing progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/progress-reporting.html#CREATE-INDEX-PROGRESS-REPORTING)\n\n```sql\nSELECT phase, round(100.0 * blocks_done / nullif(blocks_total, 0), 1) AS \"%\" FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;\n```\n\nThe phases for HNSW are:\n\n1. `initializing`\n2. `loading tuples`\n\n## IVFFlat\n\nAn IVFFlat index divides vectors into lists, and then searches a subset of those lists that are closest to the query vector. It has faster build times and uses less memory than HNSW, but has lower query performance (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff).\n\nThree keys to achieving good recall are:\n\n1. Create the index *after* the table has some data\n2. Choose an appropriate number of lists - a good place to start is `rows / 1000` for up to 1M rows and `sqrt(rows)` for over 1M rows\n3. When querying, specify an appropriate number of [probes](#query-options) (higher is better for recall, lower is better for speed) - a good place to start is `sqrt(lists)`\n\nAdd an index for each distance function you want to use.\n\nL2 distance\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);\n```\n\nNote: Use `halfvec_l2_ops` for `halfvec` (and similar with the other distance functions)\n\nInner product\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_ip_ops) WITH (lists = 100);\n```\n\nCosine distance\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);\n```\n\nHamming distance\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding bit_hamming_ops) WITH (lists = 100);\n```\n\nSupported types are:\n\n- `vector` - up to 2,000 dimensions\n- `halfvec` - up to 4,000 dimensions\n- `bit` - up to 64,000 dimensions\n\n### Query Options\n\nSpecify the number of probes (1 by default)\n\n```sql\nSET ivfflat.probes = 10;\n```\n\nA higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed, and it can be set to the number of lists for exact nearest neighbor search (at which point the planner won\u2019t use the index)\n\nUse `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set it for a single query\n\n```sql\nBEGIN;\nSET LOCAL ivfflat.probes = 10;\nSELECT ...\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n### Index Build Time\n\nSpeed up index creation on large tables by increasing the number of parallel workers (2 by default)\n\n```sql\nSET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7; -- plus leader\n```\n\nFor a large number of workers, you may also need to increase `max_parallel_workers` (8 by default)\n\n### Indexing Progress\n\nCheck [indexing progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/progress-reporting.html#CREATE-INDEX-PROGRESS-REPORTING)\n\n```sql\nSELECT phase, round(100.0 * tuples_done / nullif(tuples_total, 0), 1) AS \"%\" FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;\n```\n\nThe phases for IVFFlat are:\n\n1. `initializing`\n2. `performing k-means`\n3. `assigning tuples`\n4. `loading tuples`\n\nNote: `%` is only populated during the `loading tuples` phase\n\n## Filtering\n\nThere are a few ways to index nearest neighbor queries with a `WHERE` clause.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items WHERE category_id = 123 ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nA good place to start is creating an index on the filter column. This can provide fast, exact nearest neighbor search in many cases. Postgres has a number of [index types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html) for this: B-tree (default), hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, and BRIN.\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items (category_id);\n```\n\nFor multiple columns, consider a [multicolumn index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-multicolumn.html).\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items (location_id, category_id);\n```\n\nExact indexes work well for conditions that match a low percentage of rows. Otherwise, [approximate indexes](#indexing) can work better.\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);\n```\n\nWith approximate indexes, filtering is applied *after* the index is scanned. If a condition matches 10% of rows, with HNSW and the default `hnsw.ef_search` of 40, only 4 rows will match on average. For more rows, increase `hnsw.ef_search`.\n\n```sql\nSET hnsw.ef_search = 200;\n```\n\nStarting with 0.8.0, you can enable [iterative index scans](#iterative-index-scans), which will automatically scan more of the index when needed.\n\n```sql\nSET hnsw.iterative_scan = strict_order;\n```\n\nIf filtering by only a few distinct values, consider [partial indexing](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html).\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WHERE (category_id = 123);\n```\n\nIf filtering by many different values, consider [partitioning](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html).\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE items (embedding vector(3), category_id int) PARTITION BY LIST(category_id);\n```\n\n## Iterative Index Scans\n\nWith approximate indexes, queries with filtering can return less results since filtering is applied *after* the index is scanned. Starting with 0.8.0, you can enable iterative index scans, which will automatically scan more of the index until enough results are found (or it reaches `hnsw.max_scan_tuples` or `ivfflat.max_probes`).\n\nIterative scans can use strict or relaxed ordering.\n\nStrict ensures results are in the exact order by distance\n\n```sql\nSET hnsw.iterative_scan = strict_order;\n```\n\nRelaxed allows results to be slightly out of order by distance, but provides better recall\n\n```sql\nSET hnsw.iterative_scan = relaxed_order;\n# or\nSET ivfflat.iterative_scan = relaxed_order;\n```\n\nWith relaxed ordering, you can use a [materialized CTE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html#QUERIES-WITH-CTE-MATERIALIZATION) to get strict ordering\n\n```sql\nWITH relaxed_results AS MATERIALIZED (\n    SELECT id, embedding <-> '[1,2,3]' AS distance FROM items WHERE category_id = 123 ORDER BY distance LIMIT 5\n) SELECT * FROM relaxed_results ORDER BY distance + 0;\n```\n\nNote: `+ 0` is needed for Postgres 17+\n\nFor queries that filter by distance, use a materialized CTE and place the distance filter outside of it for best performance (due to the [current behavior](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CAOdR5yGUoMQ6j7M5hNUXrySzaqZVGf_Ne%2B8fwZMRKTFxU1nbJg%40mail.gmail.com) of the Postgres executor)\n\n```sql\nWITH nearest_results AS MATERIALIZED (\n    SELECT id, embedding <-> '[1,2,3]' AS distance FROM items ORDER BY distance LIMIT 5\n) SELECT * FROM nearest_results WHERE distance < 5 ORDER BY distance;\n```\n\nNote: Place any other filters inside the CTE\n\n### Iterative Scan Options\n\nSince scanning a large portion of an approximate index is expensive, there are options to control when a scan ends.\n\n#### HNSW\n\nSpecify the max number of tuples to visit (20,000 by default)\n\n```sql\nSET hnsw.max_scan_tuples = 20000;\n```\n\nNote: This is approximate and does not affect the initial scan\n\nSpecify the max amount of memory to use, as a multiple of `work_mem` (1 by default)\n\n```sql\nSET hnsw.scan_mem_multiplier = 2;\n```\n\nNote: Try increasing this if increasing `hnsw.max_scan_tuples` does not improve recall\n\n#### IVFFlat\n\nSpecify the max number of probes\n\n```sql\nSET ivfflat.max_probes = 100;\n```\n\nNote: If this is lower than `ivfflat.probes`, `ivfflat.probes` will be used\n\n## Half-Precision Vectors\n\nUse the `halfvec` type to store half-precision vectors\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding halfvec(3));\n```\n\n## Half-Precision Indexing\n\nIndex vectors at half precision for smaller indexes\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw ((embedding::halfvec(3)) halfvec_l2_ops);\n```\n\nGet the nearest neighbors\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding::halfvec(3) <-> '[1,2,3]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\n## Binary Vectors\n\nUse the `bit` type to store binary vectors ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/imagehash/example.py))\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding bit(3));\nINSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('000'), ('111');\n```\n\nGet the nearest neighbors by Hamming distance\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <~> '101' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nAlso supports Jaccard distance (`<%>`)\n\n## Binary Quantization\n\nUse expression indexing for binary quantization\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw ((binary_quantize(embedding)::bit(3)) bit_hamming_ops);\n```\n\nGet the nearest neighbors by Hamming distance\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY binary_quantize(embedding)::bit(3) <~> binary_quantize('[1,-2,3]') LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nRe-rank by the original vectors for better recall\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM (\n    SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY binary_quantize(embedding)::bit(3) <~> binary_quantize('[1,-2,3]') LIMIT 20\n) ORDER BY embedding <=> '[1,-2,3]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\n## Sparse Vectors\n\nUse the `sparsevec` type to store sparse vectors\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding sparsevec(5));\n```\n\nInsert vectors\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('{1:1,3:2,5:3}/5'), ('{1:4,3:5,5:6}/5');\n```\n\nThe format is `{index1:value1,index2:value2}/dimensions` and indices start at 1 like SQL arrays\n\nGet the nearest neighbors by L2 distance\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '{1:3,3:1,5:2}/5' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\n## Hybrid Search\n\nUse together with Postgres [full-text search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-intro.html) for hybrid search.\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, content FROM items, plainto_tsquery('hello search') query\n    WHERE textsearch @@ query ORDER BY ts_rank_cd(textsearch, query) DESC LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nYou can use [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/hybrid_search/rrf.py) or a [cross-encoder](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/hybrid_search/cross_encoder.py) to combine results.\n\n## Indexing Subvectors\n\nUse expression indexing to index subvectors\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw ((subvector(embedding, 1, 3)::vector(3)) vector_cosine_ops);\n```\n\nGet the nearest neighbors by cosine distance\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY subvector(embedding, 1, 3)::vector(3) <=> subvector('[1,2,3,4,5]'::vector, 1, 3) LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nRe-rank by the full vectors for better recall\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM (\n    SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY subvector(embedding, 1, 3)::vector(3) <=> subvector('[1,2,3,4,5]'::vector, 1, 3) LIMIT 20\n) ORDER BY embedding <=> '[1,2,3,4,5]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\n## Performance\n\n### Tuning\n\nUse a tool like [PgTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) to set initial values for Postgres server parameters. For instance, `shared_buffers` should typically be 25% of the server\u2019s memory. You can find the config file with:\n\n```sql\nSHOW config_file;\n```\n\nAnd check individual settings with:\n\n```sql\nSHOW shared_buffers;\n```\n\nBe sure to restart Postgres for changes to take effect.\n\n### Loading\n\nUse `COPY` for bulk loading data ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/loading/example.py)).\n\n```sql\nCOPY items (embedding) FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY);\n```\n\nAdd any indexes *after* loading the initial data for best performance.\n\n### Indexing\n\nSee index build time for [HNSW](#index-build-time) and [IVFFlat](#index-build-time-1).\n\nIn production environments, create indexes concurrently to avoid blocking writes.\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ...\n```\n\n### Querying\n\nUse `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to debug performance.\n\n```sql\nEXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\n#### Exact Search\n\nTo speed up queries without an index, increase `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`.\n\n```sql\nSET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;\n```\n\nIf vectors are normalized to length 1 (like [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/which-distance-function-should-i-use)), use inner product for best performance.\n\n```tsql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <#> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\n#### Approximate Search\n\nTo speed up queries with an IVFFlat index, increase the number of inverted lists (at the expense of recall).\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 1000);\n```\n\n### Vacuuming\n\nVacuuming can take a while for HNSW indexes. Speed it up by reindexing first.\n\n```sql\nREINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_name;\nVACUUM table_name;\n```\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitor performance with [pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) (be sure to add it to `shared_preload_libraries`).\n\n```sql\nCREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;\n```\n\nGet the most time-consuming queries with:\n\n```sql\nSELECT query, calls, ROUND((total_plan_time + total_exec_time) / calls) AS avg_time_ms,\n    ROUND((total_plan_time + total_exec_time) / 60000) AS total_time_min\n    FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_plan_time + total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 20;\n```\n\nMonitor recall by comparing results from approximate search with exact search.\n\n```sql\nBEGIN;\nSET LOCAL enable_indexscan = off; -- use exact search\nSELECT ...\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n## Scaling\n\nScale pgvector the same way you scale Postgres.\n\nScale vertically by increasing memory, CPU, and storage on a single instance. Use existing tools to [tune parameters](#tuning) and [monitor performance](#monitoring).\n\nScale horizontally with [replicas](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html), or use [Citus](https://github.com/citusdata/citus) or another approach for sharding ([example](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python/blob/master/examples/citus/example.py)).\n\n## Languages\n\nUse pgvector from any language with a Postgres client.

A partitioned table can have thousands of partitions of that size.\n\n#### Is replication supported?\n\nYes, pgvector uses the write-ahead log (WAL), which allows for replication and point-in-time recovery.\n\n#### What if I want to index vectors with more than 2,000 dimensions?\n\nYou can use [half-precision indexing](#half-precision-indexing) to index up to 4,000 dimensions or [binary quantization](#binary-quantization) to index up to 64,000 dimensions. Another option is [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction).\n\n#### Can I store vectors with different dimensions in the same column?\n\nYou can use `vector` as the type (instead of `vector(n)`).\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE embeddings (model_id bigint, item_id bigint, embedding vector, PRIMARY KEY (model_id, item_id));\n```\n\nHowever, you can only create indexes on rows with the same number of dimensions (using [expression](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-expressional.html) and [partial](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html) indexing):\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON embeddings USING hnsw ((embedding::vector(3)) vector_l2_ops) WHERE (model_id = 123);\n```\n\nand query with:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM embeddings WHERE model_id = 123 ORDER BY embedding::vector(3) <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\n#### Can I store vectors with more precision?\n\nYou can use the `double precision[]` or `numeric[]` type to store vectors with more precision.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding double precision[]);\n\n-- use {} instead of [] for Postgres arrays\nINSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('{1,2,3}'), ('{4,5,6}');\n```\n\nOptionally, add a [check constraint](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html) to ensure data can be converted to the `vector` type and has the expected dimensions.\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE items ADD CHECK (vector_dims(embedding::vector) = 3);\n```\n\nUse [expression indexing](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-expressional.html) to index (at a lower precision):\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw ((embedding::vector(3)) vector_l2_ops);\n```\n\nand query with:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding::vector(3) <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;\n```\n\n#### Do indexes need to fit into memory?\n\nNo, but like other index types, you\u2019ll likely see better performance if they do. You can get the size of an index with:\n\n```sql\nSELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('index_name'));\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n#### Why isn\u2019t a query using an index?\n\nThe query needs to have an `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, and the `ORDER BY` must be the result of a distance operator (not an expression) in ascending order.\n\n```sql\n-- index\nORDER BY embedding <=> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;\n\n-- no index\nORDER BY 1 - (embedding <=> '[3,1,2]') DESC LIMIT 5;\n```\n\nYou can encourage the planner to use an index for a query with:\n\n```sql\nBEGIN;\nSET LOCAL enable_seqscan = off;\nSELECT ...\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\nAlso, if the table is small, a table scan may be faster.\n\n#### Why isn\u2019t a query using a parallel table scan?\n\nThe planner doesn\u2019t consider [out-of-line storage](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html) in cost estimates, which can make a serial scan look cheaper. You can reduce the cost of a parallel scan for a query with:\n\n```sql\nBEGIN;\nSET LOCAL min_parallel_table_scan_size = 1;\nSET LOCAL parallel_setup_cost = 1;\nSELECT ...\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\nor choose to store vectors inline:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE items ALTER COLUMN embedding SET STORAGE PLAIN;\n```\n\n#### Why are there less results for a query after adding an HNSW index?\n\nResults are limited by the size of the dynamic candidate list (`hnsw.ef_search`), which is 40 by default. There may be even less results due to dead tuples or filtering conditions in the query. Enabling [iterative index scans](#iterative-index-scans) can help address this.\n\nAlso, note that `NULL` vectors are not indexed (as well as zero vectors for cosine distance).\n\n#### Why are there less results for a query after adding an IVFFlat index?\n\nThe index was likely created with too little data for the number of lists. Drop the index until the table has more data.\n\n```sql\nDROP INDEX index_name;\n```\n\nResults can also be limited by the number of probes (`ivfflat.probes`). Enabling [iterative index scans](#iterative-index-scans) can address this.\n\nAlso, note that `NULL` vectors are not indexed (as well as zero vectors for cosine distance).\n\n## Reference\n\n- [Vector](#vector-type)\n- [Halfvec](#halfvec-type)\n- [Bit](#bit-type)\n- [Sparsevec](#sparsevec-type)\n\n### Vector Type\n\nEach vector takes `4 * dimensions + 8` bytes of storage.

If `sudo` is needed for `make install`, use:\n\n```sh\nsudo --preserve-env=PG_CONFIG make install\n```\n\nA few common paths on Mac are:\n\n- EDB installer - `/Library/PostgreSQL/18/bin/pg_config`\n- Homebrew (arm64) - `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@18/bin/pg_config`\n- Homebrew (x86-64) - `/usr/local/opt/postgresql@18/bin/pg_config`\n\nNote: Replace `18` with your Postgres server version\n\n### Missing Header\n\nIf compilation fails with `fatal error: postgres.h: No such file or directory`, make sure Postgres development files are installed on the server.\n\nFor Ubuntu and Debian, use:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt install postgresql-server-dev-18\n```\n\nNote: Replace `18` with your Postgres server version\n\n### Missing SDK\n\nIf compilation fails and the output includes `warning: no such sysroot directory` on Mac, your Postgres installation points to a path that no longer exists.\n\n```sh\npg_config --cppflags\n```\n\nReinstall Postgres to fix this.\n\n### Portability\n\nBy default, pgvector compiles with `-march=native` on some platforms for best performance. However, this can lead to `Illegal instruction` errors if trying to run the compiled extension on a different machine.\n\nTo compile for portability, use:\n\n```sh\nmake OPTFLAGS=\"\"\n```\n\n## Installation Notes - Windows\n\n### Missing Header\n\nIf compilation fails with `Cannot open include file: 'postgres.h': No such file or directory`, make sure `PGROOT` is correct.\n\n### Mismatched Architecture\n\nIf compilation fails with `error C2196: case value '4' already used`, make sure you\u2019re using the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`. Then run `nmake /F Makefile.win clean` and re-run the installation instructions.\n\n### Missing Symbol\n\nIf linking fails with `unresolved external symbol float_to_shortest_decimal_bufn` with Postgres 17.0-17.2, upgrade to Postgres 17.3+.\n\n### Permissions\n\nIf installation fails with `Access is denied`, re-run the installation instructions as an administrator.\n\n## Additional Installation Methods\n\n### Docker\n\nGet the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pgvector/pgvector) with:\n\n```sh\ndocker pull pgvector/pgvector:pg18-trixie\n```\n\nThis adds pgvector to the [Postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) (replace `18` with your Postgres server version, and run it the same way).\n\nSupported tags are:\n\n- `pg18-trixie`, `0.8.1-pg18-trixie`\n- `pg18-bookworm`, `0.8.1-pg18-bookworm`, `pg18`, `0.8.1-pg18`\n- `pg17-trixie`, `0.8.1-pg17-trixie`\n- `pg17-bookworm`, `0.8.1-pg17-bookworm`, `pg17`, `0.8.1-pg17`\n- `pg16-trixie`, `0.8.1-pg16-trixie`\n- `pg16-bookworm`, `0.8.1-pg16-bookworm`, `pg16`, `0.8.1-pg16`\n- `pg15-trixie`, `0.8.1-pg15-trixie`\n- `pg15-bookworm`, `0.8.1-pg15-bookworm`, `pg15`, `0.8.1-pg15`\n- `pg14-trixie`, `0.8.1-pg14-trixie`\n- `pg14-bookworm`, `0.8.1-pg14-bookworm`, `pg14`, `0.8.1-pg14`\n- `pg13-trixie`, `0.8.1-pg13-trixie`\n- `pg13-bookworm`, `0.8.1-pg13-bookworm`, `pg13`, `0.8.1-pg13`\n\nYou can also build the image manually:\n\n```sh\ngit clone --branch v0.8.1 https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git\ncd pgvector\ndocker build --pull --build-arg PG_MAJOR=18 -t myuser/pgvector .\n```\n\nIf you increase `maintenance_work_mem`, make sure `--shm-size` is at least that size to avoid an error with parallel HNSW index builds.\n\n```sh\ndocker run --shm-size=1g ...\n```\n\n### Homebrew\n\nWith Homebrew Postgres, you can use:\n\n```sh\nbrew install pgvector\n```\n\nNote: This only adds it to the `postgresql@18` and `postgresql@17` formulas\n\n### PGXN\n\nInstall from the [PostgreSQL Extension Network](https://pgxn.org/dist/vector) with:\n\n```sh\npgxn install vector\n```\n\n### APT\n\nDebian and Ubuntu packages are available from the [PostgreSQL APT Repository](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt).
